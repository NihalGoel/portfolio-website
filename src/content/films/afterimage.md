*Afterimage* documents the demolition of a Brutalist housing estate in East London over the course of six months. Using time-lapse, thermal imaging, and traditional cinematography, the film constructs a visual elegy to the building and its former inhabitants.

The title references the optical phenomenon of afterimages — the persistent visual impression that remains after looking at a bright object — as a metaphor for architectural memory.
