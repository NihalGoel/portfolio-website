*Structure of Forgetting* interweaves three narrative threads: the systematic demolition of a post-war housing block in Berlin, interviews with former residents, and close-up studies of the building's materials — concrete aggregate, wire mesh, ceramic tiles — as they are crushed and recycled.

The film treats demolition not as destruction but as a form of material archaeology, revealing the layered histories embedded in built structures.
