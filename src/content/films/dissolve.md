*Dissolve* was shot on expired 16mm film stock recovered from a shuttered cinema in Thessaloniki, Greece. The inherent chemical deterioration of the celluloid — its colour shifts, emulsion bubbles, and silver halide decay — becomes the primary visual material.

The film moves through a series of abandoned theatres and cinemas across Southern Europe, each one captured in a single, unbroken take. As the film stock degrades, the architectural spaces dissolve into pure colour and texture, mirroring the buildings' own physical decline.
