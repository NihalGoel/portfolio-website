*Residual Light* captures long-exposure photographs taken inside decommissioned factories and power stations across Europe. Each image records the ambient light that persists in these spaces — reflected sunlight, distant street lamps, emergency exit signs — over exposures lasting between four and twelve hours.

The resulting prints reveal luminous geometries invisible to the naked eye, transforming industrial ruins into ethereal light-fields.
