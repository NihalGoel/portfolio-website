*Thresholds* investigates the phenomenology of architectural transition — the charged moment of crossing from one space into another. The installation consists of a series of translucent scrim walls suspended within the gallery, each printed with fragments of demolished buildings sourced from municipal archives.

Visitors navigate through overlapping layers of semi-transparent imagery, their own shadows blending with projected archival footage of doorways, corridors, and stairwells. The work creates an immersive environment where past and present architecture coexist in a state of perpetual dissolution.

The piece was commissioned for the Serpentine Gallery's annual pavilion programme and remained on view for three months, attracting over 40,000 visitors.
