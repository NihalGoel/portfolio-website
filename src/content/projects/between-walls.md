*Between Walls* presents four synchronized video channels projected onto free-standing concrete panels within the gallery. Each channel follows the interior of a different abandoned apartment building in New York's outer boroughs, filmed over the course of two years as the buildings awaited demolition.

The camera moves slowly through empty rooms, capturing traces of habitation — wallpaper fragments, nail holes, light patterns — while a spatial audio composition derived from field recordings fills the installation space.
