*Hollow Ground* is a series of concrete casts taken from underground voids — abandoned basements, collapsed tunnels, and disused utility channels — beneath the city of Basel. Each sculpture is an inverted record of negative space: the solid form represents what was once empty, while the cavities in each piece correspond to the structural elements that once surrounded the void.

The works are displayed on low steel platforms, arranged to echo the spatial relationships of the original underground network.
